# Weather app

Challenge: Create a weather app using an API. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can see city weather as default, preferably my current location
- User story: I can search for city
- User story: I can see weather of today and the next 5 days
- User story: I can see the date and location of the weather
- User story: I can see according to image for each type of weather
- User story: I can see the min and max degree each day
- User story: I can see wind status and wind direction
- User story: I can see humidity percentage
- User story: I can see a visibility indicator
- User story: I can see the air pressure number

If you want see the weather app you need to install the extension [Allow CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=es) otherwise the browser will block all CORS.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
